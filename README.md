# Terran

## FEATURES
It's basically a copied human race with some modifications, taken from the Apex.
I think I've added enough custom content to not call it a "copy" anymore. Though, the Apex uniforms and Ship are here to stay, because I really do like them. and that was original intent with this mod.

But I will continue to work on this and add more custom content. One step at a time.
So stay tuned for more Terran Command goodies!
* Apex slightly modified starter ship Custom Terran Command starter ship First three tiers are Apex, rest is human. Soon to be modified with Apex ship details.
* Apex uniforms
* Tutorial quest
* Custom Terran Command sign
* Custom crafting table called, Quantum Relay Supply System (QRSS for short)
* MRE (Meal Ready to Eat), can be crafted with any edible food and one fabric (Kinda obsolete now, I think. Haven't tested.)
* Custom Terran lore available In-Game from the start
* Custom hairs, credits to @TimeCraked and @Dragonith
* Custom Apex HDTV, a non-animated object turned into an animated object.

**Planned-Features**
* Apex villages with human/terran look and NPC's. (I.E. Friendly human settlements, tired of the USCM bases and Penal colonies with only hostiles. Why would the only humans left in the galaxy be all hostiles?)
Codex with more lore/background info. (Feel free to post suggestions.)

## CODEX
If anyone wants to submit Codex stories, feel free to do so. Either in a thread here, or via a PM if you wish to keep it private, for players discover them In-Game.

The Codex entry can be anything you'd want, somehow related to Terran.

Maybe a Captain log or a diary for your Terran character? Or an event in Terran history?
Some story from another Terran colony? Anything you'd like.

**Collaborators**
* Norway174 (A Terran Introduction, Terran Command & Terra Nova)
* Admon_420 (AU-1001 EM)

## HELP WANTED!
I'm currently looking for pixel art, that would fit with the Terran theme.

A short list of what I would need the most:

1. More weapons (Pistols, machine gun, rifle, shotgun, other.)
1. Exo-skeleton (From Edge of Tomorrow or Advanced Warfare. I've already started working on this. But it sucks. :p )
1. (back) Flashlight (Because lantern-on-a-stick isn't sci-fi enough. Been planning this for a while. Not sure what to make it yet. Maybe something like the health bar from Dead Space? But that would only be backside visible. Or a glow stick over your shoulder?)
1. Ships. More ships. (Already started on a space station where the player will spawn on. I'm still missing all the different ship classes. See earlier post about [different ship classes](http://community.playstarbound.com/index.php?threads/terran.86030/page-4#post-2410690).)


## End words
I know this isn't really the most feature rich race mod. And I never intended it to be.

So I made this because I dislike how the human race is portrayed in the game. The only humans I have ever met are all hostiles. (Bandits, prison & bunker)

I plan on updating this more as I can, and adding to the world gen, using the Apex villages as a base, and give it a more "human" look and feel. And less like a monkey madness dictatorship.

If anyone wants to help out with anything, or even have some suggestions, please let me know. I'd appreciate any help or feedback.

Though, I originally made it for my own personal use. With my own vision and idea in mind. But I do hope others find this quite enjoyable as well.

Great for military styled RP characters. As I envision Terran Command as the military to the Terrans.
